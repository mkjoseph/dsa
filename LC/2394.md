Joining Tables:

We use a LEFT JOIN to include all employees from the Employees table, even those without records in the Logs table (who haven't worked any hours).
Calculating Total Hours Worked:

The inner subquery groups by employee_id and calculates the total work hours spent across all sessions:
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, in_time, out_time): Finds the difference in minutes between start and end times.
CEIL(... / 60.0): Converts minutes to hours (rounding up partial hours).
SUM(): Aggregates the total working hours for each employee.
Filtering for Deductions:

The WHERE clause filters employees who meet either of these conditions:
l.total_hours_worked < e.needed_hours: Their work hours are less than the required hours.
l.total_hours_worked IS NULL: They have no logs (didn't work at all).
Key Points:

Handling Overnight Shifts: The TIMESTAMPDIFF function correctly computes the duration of shifts that cross midnight.
Rounding Up Working Hours: The CEIL function aligns with the problem's specification of rounding up fractional hours.
Employees Without Logs: The LEFT JOIN and IS NULL condition cover employees who didn't work.
