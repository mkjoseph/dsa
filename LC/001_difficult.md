Trapping Rain Water: This problem requires understanding of dynamic programming or stack data structures. It involves calculating the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between bars of varying heights.

Regular Expression Matching: This problem is a classic in computer science, requiring knowledge of string manipulation and dynamic programming. It asks to implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' characters.

Median of Two Sorted Arrays: This is a high-level problem that requires a good grasp of binary search algorithms. The challenge is to find the median of two sorted arrays in logarithmic time complexity.

Sliding Window Maximum: This problem requires efficient data structure manipulation, particularly using dequeues or heaps. It involves finding the maximum value in each sliding window of a given size across an array.

Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree: This problem is about designing an algorithm to serialize a binary tree into a string and then deserialize that string back into the original tree structure.

Longest Valid Parentheses: This involves using stacks or dynamic programming to find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

Minimum Window Substring: A problem that requires understanding of sliding windows and hash maps, where you have to find the minimum window in a string which will contain all the characters of another string.

Word Ladder II: This is a graph-based problem where you need to find all shortest transformation sequences from a start word to an end word given a dictionary of word lists.

Largest Rectangle in Histogram: It involves complex understanding of stacks and arrays, where the goal is to find the largest rectangular area in a histogram.

First Missing Positive: This is a tricky problem requiring a clever approach to find the smallest missing positive integer from an unsorted array.
