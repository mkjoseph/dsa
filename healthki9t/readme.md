Problem Description

Building a mini app that leverages AppleHealth kit. Unsure of the current limitations when working with AppleHealthkit, and looking to build out a small app within a few phases. The first phase is just about capturing apple health data into a firebase db and permissions for a future version. From here, we will determine functionality and the next phase of the project.

User flow

Download and open app
Create account (apple sign-in)
Authentication - Send to firebase
Check for Apple Watch (https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/6021)
Pass or fail
If pass, collect Apple Watch Version in firebase
If fail, display alert
Create Profile
Capture name (new controller)
Capture username / @handle
Send to firebase
Connect Apple Health Data
Pass or fail
Pass data to firebase (5 specific metrics from Apple Health)
Connect Address Book
Capture and Store in Firebase
This will be used for future use
Connect Push Notifications
Capture and Store in Firebase
This will be used for future use
Controller view - Success message. "Check back soon"
The user must allow all steps in order to complete registration (to arrive at last steps)

To summarize, this app is about creating a user, ensuring they have an apple watch, then passing apple health data to a database.

Once you reach out, I can pass over a wireframe. This is less about perfect design, and more about basic functionality.

Swift
Firebase
Documented code, using GitHub



To tackle this project, we'll break down the solution into several key components, aligning with the user flow and the technical requirements described. Here's an overview of how we can approach building this app, focusing on Swift for iOS development and Firebase for backend services.

### Phase 1: Setting up the Project

1. **Initialize a new Swift project** in Xcode with the necessary configurations for iOS and watchOS targets if you're planning to include an Apple Watch extension.
2. **Firebase Setup**: Integrate Firebase into your iOS project. This involves adding Firebase SDK through CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager, and configuring your project in the Firebase console.
3. **Apple HealthKit Setup**: Enable HealthKit for your project in Xcode and ensure you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` file.

### Phase 2: User Authentication and Profile Creation

1. **Apple Sign-In**: Implement Sign in with Apple to authenticate users. You'll need to handle the authentication flow to receive a user token, which you'll then send to Firebase for verification and account creation.
2. **Firebase Authentication**: Configure Firebase Authentication to support Sign in with Apple, and securely manage user sessions.
3. **Profile Creation**: After authentication, prompt the user for additional information like name and username. Use Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database to store this information.

### Phase 3: Apple Watch and HealthKit Data

1. **Check for Apple Watch**: Utilize the `WatchConnectivity` framework to establish a connection between the iOS app and a paired Apple Watch. Check the linked forum thread and official documentation for guidance on detecting a connected Apple Watch.
2. **HealthKit Data**: Request permission from the user to access HealthKit data. Specify the types of data you wish to access (e.g., steps, heart rate, etc.). Once granted, fetch the data and structure it for Firebase storage.

### Phase 4: Additional Features and Data Handling

1. **Address Book and Push Notifications**: Use appropriate APIs (Contacts for address book, UNUserNotificationCenter for notifications) to request permissions and access data. Store the necessary information in Firebase as per your app's requirements.
2. **Firebase Storage**: For each feature (HealthKit data, address book, notifications), design your database schema to efficiently store and retrieve data. Pay attention to Firebase's best practices for security and data structuring.

### Phase 5: Finalizing and Testing

1. **Success Message and UI Flow**: Ensure the app navigates users through each step of the process smoothly, handling both success and failure cases gracefully.
2. **Testing**: Rigorously test your app on multiple devices and iOS versions to ensure compatibility and stability. Include unit and integration tests to automate testing of critical functionalities.
3. **Documentation and Version Control**: Use GitHub for version control and document your codebase thoroughly to explain your logic, function purposes, and any important decisions made during development.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Swift**: Main programming language for iOS and watchOS development.
- **Firebase**: Backend services for authentication, database, and potentially cloud functions if needed for complex operations.
- **HealthKit**: Apple's framework for accessing health and fitness data.
- **WatchConnectivity**: For communication between iOS and watchOS apps.

### Next Steps

1. **Start with a Prototype**: Begin by setting up a basic project structure and integrating Firebase and HealthKit. Focus on getting a simple flow working from authentication to data capture.
2. **Iterate and Expand**: Add features progressively, testing extensively at each stage.
3. **Review and Optimize**: Pay attention to performance, especially with data fetching and storage operations.
