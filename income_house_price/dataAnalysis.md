To assist you effectively, I'll start by examining the contents of the uploaded CSV file to understand its structure. This will guide us in designing both the Swift and Python programs for compiling it into an investment analysis. Let's first peek at the contents of the file.

The CSV file contains rental price data for various ZIP codes over time, with columns for region identifiers, size ranking, region names (ZIP codes), region types, state names, cities, metros, county names, and monthly rental prices from January 2015 through January 2024. 

Given this structure, the investment analysis program can include functionalities to:
- Parse the CSV file.
- Calculate average rental price growth over the selected period for each ZIP code.
- Identify the top performing ZIP codes based on rental price growth.
- Possibly, analyze rental yield if additional data (like purchase prices) is provided or estimated.

I'll first write a Swift program that reads this CSV, performs basic analysis to calculate average annual growth rates for each ZIP code, and identifies top ZIP codes for investment based on this metric. Then, I'll translate this functionality into Python. 

### Swift Program
Swift isn't typically used for data analysis in this manner, and working with CSV files can be more complex than in Python. Swift programs usually run within an iOS or macOS application context, so for simplicity, the following example will assume you're running this in a Swift script or playground that supports importing external libraries for CSV parsing (like `SwiftCSV`). However, without direct support for such libraries in a basic script, the process would involve manually parsing the CSV data, which is significantly more cumbersome.

```swift
import SwiftCSV // Assuming availability. Real usage might require a custom CSV parsing approach.

struct ZipCodeInvestmentData {
    var zipCode: String
    var averageAnnualGrowthRate: Double
}

func loadCSV(fromPath path: String) -> CSV? {
    // Attempt to load and parse the CSV file
    do {
        let csv = try CSV(name: path)
        return csv
    } catch {
        print("Error loading CSV file: \(error)")
        return nil
    }
}

func calculateInvestmentData(fromCSV csv: CSV) -> [ZipCodeInvestmentData] {
    var investmentData: [ZipCodeInvestmentData] = []

    // Iterate through rows and calculate average growth rate for each ZIP code
    // Simplified: Actual calculation should account for missing data and compute based on available data points

    for row in csv.namedRows {
        let zipCode = row["RegionName"] ?? ""
        // Example calculation logic here, replace with actual growth rate calculation
        let growthRate = 0.05 // Placeholder for actual calculation
        investmentData.append(ZipCodeInvestmentData(zipCode: zipCode, averageAnnualGrowthRate: growthRate))
    }

    return investmentData
}

// Example usage
if let csv = loadCSV(fromPath: "path/to/your/file.csv") {
    let data = calculateInvestmentData(fromCSV: csv)
    // Further processing like sorting and filtering for top ZIP codes
}
```

Now, I'll create the equivalent functionality in Python, which is more suited for this kind of data analysis and doesn't require external libraries for basic CSV operations due to its powerful `pandas` library.

### Python Program

Python is well-equipped for data analysis tasks, thanks to libraries like Pandas. The following program demonstrates how to achieve the outlined investment analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd

def load_csv(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)

def calculate_average_annual_growth_rate(data):
    # Calculate the average annual growth rate for each ZIP code
    growth_rates = []
    for index, row in data.iterrows():
        # Example: Calculate growth rate based on the first and last available monthly data
        # This is a simplification; you might want to calculate monthly growth rates and average them
        start_price = row.dropna().iloc[-13]  # Assuming the last 12 months + 1 for the first non-NaN value
        end_price = row.dropna().iloc[-1]
        years = 1  # Simplification for example purposes; calculate based on actual dates for precision
        growth_rate = ((end_price / start_price) ** (1 / years)) - 1
        growth_rates.append((row['RegionName'], growth_rate))

    return pd.DataFrame(growth_rates, columns=['ZIP Code', 'Average Annual Growth Rate'])

def find_top_zip_codes_for_investment(data, top_n=10):
    # Sort the data by growth rate and select the top N ZIP codes
    top_zip_codes = data.sort_values(by='Average Annual Growth Rate', ascending=False).head(top_n)
    return top_zip_codes

# Load the data
file_path = '/path/to/your/file.csv'  # Update this to your actual file path
data = load_csv(file_path)

# Calculate the average annual growth rates
growth_data = calculate_average_annual_growth_rate(data)

# Find the top ZIP codes for investment
top_zip_codes = find_top_zip_codes_for_investment(growth_data)

print(top_zip_codes)
```

This Python script performs the following steps:
1. **Load the CSV file**: Uses `pandas` to load and parse the CSV file.
2. **Calculate Growth Rates**: Iterates through each ZIP code to calculate its average annual growth rate. This example simplifies the calculation; in practice, you'd want to handle missing data more carefully and perhaps calculate the growth rate based on more than just the first and last values.
3. **Identify Top ZIP Codes**: After calculating growth rates, it sorts ZIP codes by their growth rate and selects the top N for investment analysis.

Please adjust the logic for calculating the average annual growth rate as needed, depending on your specific analysis criteria and data completeness.
