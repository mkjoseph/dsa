Let‚Äôs begin our coding quest by crafting an iPhone app in Swift that ranks places based on their income-to-house price ratio. Here's how we'll approach this:

### Step 1: Define the App Structure
1. **Model**: Define a `Place` model to store data for each place (like name, average income, and house price).
2. **Data Service**: Create a service to fetch or generate data for the places.
3. **Ranking Logic**: Implement a function to calculate the income-to-house price ratio and rank the places.
4. **View**: Design the user interface to display the ranked places.
5. **View Controller**: Manage the interaction between the view and the model.

### Step 2: Implement the App
1. **Setup**: Create a new Swift project in Xcode with a single view application template.
2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Define a `Place` struct with properties for name, income, and house price.
3. **Data Service**:
   - Implement a service to provide a list of places (mocked data for now).
4. **Ranking Logic**:
   - Add a function to calculate the ratio and sort the places.
5. **UI Design**:
   - Use SwiftUI to design a simple list view showing the places and their rankings.
6. **View Controller Logic**:
   - Bind the data to the view and ensure it updates when new data is loaded.

### Step 3: Test and Polish
1. **Testing**: Test the app in the simulator and fix any bugs.
2. **Polish**: Improve the UI, add error handling, and possibly add more features like filtering.

I'll start by implementing the model and proceed step-by-step. Let's code!

### Step 1: Model Implementation
Let's start by defining the `Place` struct in Swift. This struct will represent a place with its name, average income, and house price. We'll also include a computed property to calculate the income-to-house price ratio and conform to the `Comparable` protocol to easily sort these places.

```swift
import Foundation

struct Place: Identifiable, Comparable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var averageIncome: Double
    var housePrice: Double

    // Computed property to calculate the income-to-house price ratio
    var incomeHousePriceRatio: Double {
        return averageIncome / housePrice
    }

    // Conforming to Comparable for sorting
    static func < (lhs: Place, rhs: Place) -> Bool {
        return lhs.incomeHousePriceRatio < rhs.incomeHousePriceRatio
    }
}
```

This `Place` struct will serve as the basic building block for our app. Next, we'll implement a data service to provide a list of places.

### Step 2: Data Service Implementation
Now, we'll implement a mock data service to provide a list of places. This is a simple singleton class with a method that returns an array of `Place` instances. Later, this can be replaced or extended to fetch data from a real API or database.

```swift
import Foundation

class DataService {
    static let shared = DataService()

    private init() {}

    func getPlaces() -> [Place] {
        // Mocked data for demonstration
        return [
            Place(name: "City A", averageIncome: 70000, housePrice: 350000),
            Place(name: "City B", averageIncome: 85000, housePrice: 500000),
            Place(name: "City C", averageIncome: 60000, housePrice: 300000),
            // Add more places as needed
        ]
    }
}
```

With the data service ready, the next step is to design the user interface and bind this data to it. Let's proceed to the UI design using SwiftUI.

### Step 3: UI Design Implementation
For the UI, we'll create a SwiftUI view named `ContentView`. This view will display a list of places, sorted by their income-to-house price ratio in descending order. Each list item will show the place name, average income, house price, and the calculated ratio.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var places: [Place] = []

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(places.sorted { $0.incomeHousePriceRatio > $1.incomeHousePriceRatio }) { place in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(place.name)
                        .font(.headline)
                    Text("Income: \(place.averageIncome, specifier: "%.2f")")
                    Text("House Price: \(place.housePrice, specifier: "%.2f")")
                    Text("Ratio: \(place.incomeHousePriceRatio, specifier: "%.2f")")
                }
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("Income-House Price Ratio")
            .onAppear {
                self.places = DataService.shared.getPlaces()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

This implementation provides a simple yet effective user interface for our app. The places are automatically sorted and displayed when the view appears. 

The final step is to integrate all these components into an Xcode project, test the app on a simulator, and make any necessary adjustments for a polished experience.
