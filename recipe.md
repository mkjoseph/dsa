The paper investigates the capability of pretrained transformers to perform in-context learning (ICL), which is their ability to learn new tasks from a few examples without updating their weights. The key finding is the identification of a "task diversity threshold" in the pretraining dataset, which determines the transformer's ability to solve new, unseen tasks.

Below this task diversity threshold, the pretrained transformer behaves like a Bayesian estimator, limited to solving tasks similar to those in its pretraining dataset. However, when the task diversity in the pretraining data exceeds this threshold, the transformer significantly surpasses the Bayesian estimator's performance. In this scenario, its behavior aligns more with ridge regression, indicating its capacity to solve entirely new tasks that were not part of its pretraining data. This ability to deviate from the Bayesian estimator, which uses the pretraining distribution as the prior, is crucial for the transformer to optimally solve new tasks in-context.

The study also examines the effects of factors like regularization, model capacity, and task structure, highlighting the importance of task diversity in addition to data and model scale for the emergence of ICL. In layman's terms, the paper demonstrates that the diversity of tasks a transformer model is trained on is crucial for its ability to learn and solve new tasks that it has not encountered before.
